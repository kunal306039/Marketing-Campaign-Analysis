# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
As a marketing agency, we aim to maximize ROI for our clients' ad campaigns. After running campaigns on Facebook and AdWords, we need to assess which platform performs better in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-effectiveness. This will help us allocate resources efficiently and optimize our strategies for improved client outcomes.
